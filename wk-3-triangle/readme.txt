My aim for the viginere program was to be able to compute viginere encryption
which was introduced to us in Security 101 Class.

Viginere program can encrypt and decrypt the input accorting to the given keyword.

./viginere <input> <keyword> <E(for encrypt) or D(for decrypt)>

EXAMPLE:
To Encrypt:
./viginere cliftondownstation bridge e

To Decrypt:
./viginere DCQIZSOUWZTWURBLUR bridge d
